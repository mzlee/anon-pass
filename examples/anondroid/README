Anondroid app for Android 2.3 gingerbread. 

NOTE
=====

Android works best with Ubuntu 10.04 among Linux distros. I don't know about
SDK, but Android source code did not compile with higher version of Ubuntu.

Installation
============
* Install Android SDK and untar the archive
  http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html

* Install Android Platform tools and addons by running the following command inside android SDK directory. This takes a while and needs some user interaction (for HTC or Motorola devices):
  tools/android update sdk --no-ui

* Install Eclipse classic
  http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/moreinfo/classic.php

* Install Eclipse ADT plugin following the direction:
  http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/installing-adt.html

* Set the workspace to app-gingerbread directory or symlink anondroid directory to workspace of Eclipse.

Running
=======
To run on virtual device, you can press "Run" button of Eclipse IDE.

To run on physical device, you would want to look at the link below. 
http://developer.android.com/tools/device.html

For this, you should create a udev config file, enable USB debugging on the
device, and connect the device through USB. You can check connectivity `adb
devices` in `platform-tools` directory of SDK.

Once this is set up, you can press the same "Run" button to run the app on the
device.
